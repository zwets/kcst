# Configuration for sample MLST database
#
# Miniature of the MLST database maintained by CGE DTU Copenhagen
#   https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/mlst_db
#
# This config file is read by make-db.sh to determine which schemes go into
# the generated database, which human-facing scheme names to use, and what
# the loci-order should be when displaying a profile for the scheme.
#
# Format: each row specifies a scheme using three tab-separated columns:
# 1 Base name of the FSA and TSV file pair having the alleles resp. profiles.
#   make-db.sh will look for these here and in subdirectories.
# 2 Official "display" name of the MLST scheme.
# 3 Comma-separated list of loci, in "display" order.  These must match
#   column headers in the TSV file (where they may be in a different order).
