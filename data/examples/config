# Configuration for MLST database
#
# Miniature of the MLST database maintained by CGE DTU Copenhagen
#   https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/mlst_db
#
# Has three tab-separated columns:
# - Base name of the FSA and TSV files containing the alleles and profiles;
#   make-db.sh will look for these in this directory and its subdirectories.
#   The TSV file must have a header listing the column names; its first
#   column must be the sequence type (and may have any column name).
# - Official name of the MLST scheme; usually species name or species plus
#   qualifier when there are multiple schemes for a species (as with ecoli).
# - Comma-separated list of the loci in the scheme's profile; each of these
#   must match a column header in the TSV file (but not necessarily in the
#   same order).
