# Configuration for MLST database
# Miniature of the MLST database maintained by CGE DTU Copenhagen
#   https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/mlst_db
# Has three tab-separated columns:
# - base name of the FSA and TSV files containing the alleles and profiles
#   make-db.sh will look for these in this directory and its subdirectories
# - name of the MLST scheme; usually species name unless there are multiple
#   schemes (such as with E coli which has the Achtman and Pasteur schemes)
# - ordered comma-separated list of the loci names in the scheme's profile;
#   order must be the same as in the TSV file; TSV's first column must be ST
# base_name    scheme_name    loci_list
